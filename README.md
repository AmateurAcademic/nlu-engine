# nlu-engine
Encoder-Decoder zero shot domain (skill), intent, and entity tagging NLU model. This is a work in progress. Once it works really well, this repo will be moved to a Secret Sauce AI repo.

## TODO
* Refactor data_preprocessing.py for other datasets and generalize
* Refactor data_preprocessing.py and trainer.py for domain/intent tagging
* Refactor project structure to be more modular
